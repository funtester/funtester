1. FunTester generate values from regular expressions using the Xeger library
   and, thus, it is subject to the limitations of this library, described at
   https://code.google.com/p/xeger/wiki/XegerLimitations.

2. Currently, the file paths in the test generation configuration are not
   relative (they are absolute). In this way, it could be necessary, in some
   cases, to edit the project file manually in order to fix a file path
   (for instance, when a file is under version control and two different
   users have checked it out to different paths in the computer).

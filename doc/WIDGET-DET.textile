h1. Widget Details

After describing a use case, we can detail its widgets, giving useful information for test generation purposes.

In !FunTester, a widget is a _user interface element_ or just an *element*.  In the matter of the facts, an element can be more than just a widget (for instance, it can be a URL, a key,  or a waiting time). An _element_ has:
* *kind*: the kind of the element: @widget@, @url@, @command@, @key@, or @time@ (in milliseconds). The current version only supports the kind @widget@;
* *name* (_widget only_): the name of the element, as a user knows it;
* *internal name* (_widget only_): the element identification, for recognizing it in the user interface;
* *widget type* (_widget only_): the type of the widget, such as @textbox@, @combobox@, @button@, etc.;
* *editable* (_widget only_): Whether the widget is editable (i.e.: receive values from the user);
* *value type* (_editable widget only_): @string@, @integer@, @double@, @boolean@, @date@, @time@, and @datetime@;
* *business rules* (_editable widget only_ ): the [[Business_Rules|business rules]] of the editable widget.

After giving these information (including the the [[Business_Rules|business rules]]), we are ready for [[Generated_Tests|generating the test cases]].

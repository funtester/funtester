h1. Development Guidelines

h2. Subversion

Never commit these _folders_:
* @target@
* @bin@


Never commit these _files_:
* any @.jar@ file, except for a JAR that does not exist in a web repository. In this case, the JAR should be put in a @setup@ folder, in the root directory
* @dependency-reduced-pom.xml@


Each commit message should start with:
* @@new@, whether you have created something; or
* @@change@, whether you have changed or deleted something; or
* @@refactor@, whether you have refactored something.

Try to separate these tree operations (new, change, refactor) in different commits. But don't be so severe. :)

Tagging:
* A _tag_ should be created when a version became stable. It doesn't need to be released to the public, but it should be tagged.
* Start the commit message with something like "Version 1.7.3", where 1.7.3 should (obviously) be your _tag_ version number.

h2. Coding style

"Here":http://www.iwombat.com/standards/JavaStyleGuide.html there is a coding style that is close to ours. We also prefer:
* Indenting code with Tab, not spaces. A tab must be set every 4 spaces.
* Using spaces for separating parentheses in _method calls_, _conditional statements_ and _loops_.
** Example 1: @if ( x > 50 )@
** Example 2: @while ( y < 100 )@
** Example 3: @Math.pow( 2, 3 );@
* Using @final@ attributes, when applicable
* Using "JavaDoc":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc when applicable
